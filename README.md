# Pierre's Flavored Treats Shop

## Description 

This is an MVC web application for a ficitonal client. I've built this project in order to work with Many to Many relationships and User Authentication. Users are able to login or create an account in order to create, update, and delete functionality. User who aren't logged in are only able to read pages that don't reqiure being logged in. Using many to many relationship, once logged in, a user can create treats than can have many different flavors and a flavor can be associated with as many treats.
